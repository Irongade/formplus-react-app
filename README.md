# Formplus react app

Note - I changed where the site is hosted, so the link here is different from the one I submitted in the form, I have written and also sent an email to the HR on this effect.

App deployed at: https://formplus-react.web.app/

Assumptions: 

I made sure only the templates that fit the response object provided in the technical task instructions was used, as opposed to the thousands of others that do not.
I added a dark mode to the app just for fun.
I made use of CSS in JS(Styled components) for my approach.
